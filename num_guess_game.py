What will the Program do?
1 Start
2 Generate random number to guess
3 Ask player for guess
4 Was the Guess correct?

----> If YES ----> Print Out Results
----> If NO  ---->

5 Was the Guess Lower?----->YES---> 6 Print lower Message
6 NO ----> Print Higher Message
7 Are number of goes up?---> If NO Go to step 3
8 If YES ----> Print Out Results

Logic
1. The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 10.
2. It will then ask the player to enter their guess.
3. It will then check to see if that number is the same as the one the
   computer randomly generated, if it is then the player has won.
4. If the player’s guess is not the same, then it will check to see if the number is
   higher or lower than the guess and tell the player.
5. The player will have 4 goes to guess the number correctly; if they don’t guess
   the number within this number of attempts, then they will be informed that they
   have lost the game and will be told what the actual number was.
