    - Class: A class is a fundamental concept that serves as a blueprint for creating instances or objects. A Class encapsulates data/attributes and methods/procedures/functions, that operates on the data. 
    - Subclass: A Subclass is a Class that inherits from another class. 
    - Superclass: A Superclass is a Parent class from which other class inherits from.
    - Python is a Multiple Inheritance system other than Java as Python allows class to inherit from one or more classes.
